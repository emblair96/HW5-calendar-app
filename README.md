# HW5-calendar-app

## Description of Work Completed

[The Work Day Scheduler](https://emblair96.github.io/HW5-calendar-app/) features a calendar meant to reflect your schedule for the current day.  The day is broken into hour blocks covering the standard work day (9 am - 5 pm).  The user can save their schedule for a particular hour block by pressing the blue "save button", which will push the data to localStorage. The calendar marks timeframes in the past with a grey color, while the current timeframe is denoted with red and future timeframes are marked green.

## What I learned from this assignment

* Was introduced to the various libraries that facilitate working with date and time in JavaScript.

* Continued to refine jQuery skills.

## Areas for improvement

* I would like to explore how to create a calendar that offers more breadth for the user, starting with a week-long calendar, and building up to a month, etc.  

* I plan to create a sheet comparing commonly used JavaScript syntax with jQuery for myself to refer back to, as I struggled with translating vanilla JavaScript to jQuery.  

## Installation

Should you want to install this project locally, I'd recommend reviewing [Github's documentation on forking a repository](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo).  

## Usage

Please see [here](Assets/05-third-party-apis-homework-demo.gif) for how The Work Day Scheduler should operate.  

## Credits

I would like to credit my Northwestern Bootcamp instructor, Lori Culberson, and the TAs for the course, Tony and Pat.
